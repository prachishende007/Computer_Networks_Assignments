# üåê Computer Networks Assignment

## üìå Overview
This repository contains **Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) simulation files** and related documentation for the Computer Networks assignment.  
The project demonstrates the design, configuration, and analysis of computer networks using Packet Tracer.


---

## Assignments 
1. Design network for any given organization on paper. Suggest IP address scheme to be used,
network devices to be used and their specification details<br>
2. Network Representation on Network Simulator tool<br>
3. Configure classful routing<br>
4. Configure classless routing<br>
5. Configure OSPF, BGP with at least 4 routers on the network<br>
6. Configure EIGRP with at least 4 routers on the network<br>
7. Configure VLAN using layer 3 switches<br>
8. Write chat application using TCP and UDP protocols<br>
9. Configure DHCP Server<br>
10. Configure DNS Server<br>
11. Configure HTTP Server<br>
12. Configure FTP Server<br>
13. Analyze different packets using protocol analyzer tool<br>
14. Configure HTTP Server on AWS Cloud.<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Network topologies designed in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
- Configurations of:
  - IP addressing
  - Routing (Static/Dynamic)
  - VLANs and Switching
  - DHCP, DNS, HTTP, etc. (if implemented)
- Connectivity testing using **ping, traceroute, and simulation mode**.

## üöÄ How to Open
1. Install **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 8.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository:<br>
   bash<br>
   git clone https://github.com/prachishende007/Computer_Networks_Assignments.git<br>
   cd computer-networks-assignment/pkt_files
3.Open .pkt files in Packet Tracer:<br>
  Go to File ‚Üí Open<br>
  Select the desired .pkt topology<br>

## üß™ Testing the Networks
1.Use ping between devices to verify connectivity.<br>
2.Switch to Simulation Mode to observe packet flow.<br>
3.Check device configurations (ipconfig, routing tables, etc.) inside Packet Tracer.<br>
