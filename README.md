# 🌐 Computer Networks Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) simulation files** and related documentation for the Computer Networks assignment.  
The project demonstrates the design, configuration, and analysis of computer networks using Packet Tracer.


---

## ⚙️ Features
- Network topologies designed in **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
- Configurations of:
  - IP addressing
  - Routing (Static/Dynamic)
  - VLANs and Switching
  - DHCP, DNS, HTTP, etc. (if implemented)
- Connectivity testing using **ping, traceroute, and simulation mode**.

---

## 🚀 How to Open
1. Install **Cisco Packet Tracer** (version 8.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository:<br>
   bash<br>
   git clone https://github.com/username/computer-networks-assignment.git<br>
   cd computer-networks-assignment/pkt_files
3.Open .pkt files in Packet Tracer:<br>
  Go to File → Open<br>
  Select the desired .pkt topology<br>

---

##🧪 Testing the Networks
1.Use ping between devices to verify connectivity.<br>
2.Switch to Simulation Mode to observe packet flow.<br>
3.Check device configurations (ipconfig, routing tables, etc.) inside Packet Tracer.<br>
